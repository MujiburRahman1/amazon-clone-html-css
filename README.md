# 🛒 Amazon Clone - HTML & CSS Project

Welcome to my Amazon Clone project!  
This is a beginner-friendly web project where I recreated the layout of the Amazon homepage using only **HTML and CSS**.

## 📌 Introduction

This project is part of my journey to learn **web development**.  
It is built using **pure HTML5 and CSS3** — no JavaScript or frameworks yet.  
The goal was to practice layout design, flexbox, hover effects, and responsive elements.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Font Awesome (for icons)  
- Google Fonts (optional if added later)

## 📁 Project Structure


## 💻 Features Implemented

- ✅ Navigation bar with logo, location, search bar, sign-in, and cart  
- ✅ Header panel with categories  
- ✅ Hero section with background banner  
- ✅ Product category boxes with hover effect  
- ✅ Simple footer with multiple panels

## 📷 Screenshot

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Make it fully responsive on all screen sizes
- Add backend logic in future (maybe using Node.js or Firebase)

## 🌱 Learning Outcome

- HTML structure and semantic tags  
- CSS Flexbox and layout techniques  
- Reusable CSS classes and modular design
